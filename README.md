# bluejay-python
An assignment solution for a post of SDE at Bluejay Delivery, I have created a script in python that performs checks an .xlsx file and provides the information asked for in an easy to read format.
The assignment asks to Programmatically analyze the file and print in console the name and position of employees 
      a) who has worked for 7 consecutive days.
      b) who have less than 10 hours of time between shifts but greater than 1 hour
      c) Who has worked for more than 14 hours in a single shift

I have completed these three individually as well as given an extra output that checks these if all three conditions are true for a specific employee.

I have uploaded output.txt as the console ouput and employee-analyzer.py as the python script.

For installation and use there exist only 2 library dependencies{ pandas and datetime}.
